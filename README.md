# MY-SQL-PROJECTS
Welcome to my SQL projects repository! This is my first SQL project, and I’m excited to document my progress as I explore the power of data analysis using SQL.

Project Overview

In this repository, I have worked with various SQL concepts, including:

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Subqueries

Window Functions

SQL Functions (Aggregate, String, etc.)

Filtering & Grouping (DISTINCT, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.)


What This Project Demonstrates

This project highlights my passion for:
✔ Extracting and gathering data from different sources
✔ Analyzing and interpreting datasets
✔ Answering critical business questions with data-driven insights
✔ Helping organizations make informed decisions based on data

Files in This Repository

Each file contains SQL queries and explanations of different techniques used:
